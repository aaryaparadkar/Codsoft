# Portfolio
A portfolio website is for showcasing my skills, talents, and hobbies to peers and potential employers.
I am going to use HTML, CSS and Javascript for this website.
There are going to be 4 major sections, these sections are,
(1) About
(2) Skills
(3) Portfolio
(4) Contact.
The home page will be default.
